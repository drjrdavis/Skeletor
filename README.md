# Skeletor
Watershed-based segmentation software, developed for segmenting Drosophila pupal abdominal epidermis

This programme has been developed for segmenting histoblasts and larval epithelial cells (LECs) in the Drosophila pupal abdomen that have been labelled with a membrane marker, such as ECadherin-GFP, during Drosophila pupal development. It is optimised for these cells but can be used for any epithelial monolayer, with fluorescently labelled cell boundaries. Skeletor is a filter and watershed segmentation programme and was used for the initial segmentation for ground-state machine learning segmentation programmes developed in Davis et al. Current Biology 2022. 

It is programmed using Wolfram Mathematica and is designed with a simple user-interface to be as easy to use as possible with no prior knowledge of coding required. Simply click the buttons, set a threshold and off you go! If you want to examine the code, open the hidden cells with the notebook.
